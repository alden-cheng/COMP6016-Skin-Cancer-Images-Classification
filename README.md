# COMP6016-Skin-Cancer-Images-Classification
Curtin Postgraduate Project Unit COMP6016 - Topic Title Skin cancer images classification

Project: skin cancer classification
Dataset: HAM10000 dermatologic dataset

Task1ï¼š: Adapting ResNet for skin cancer images Classification
Task Content: Change the dataset with the skin cancer dataset, make changes to the resNet
for the task of coral classification. You need to make changes to the output layer since
the number of classes is different.

Task Two: Comparing Linear Classifier Performance with ResNet18 on Skin cancer image Database
Task Content: Train a linear classifier based on the raw images (flatten the three
matrices of the RGB image into a vector first and then use the linear regression method
with softmax for image classification) and compare its performance with the resNet18
model on the skin cancer dataset

Task Three: Leveraging ResNet18 Features for Improved Skin Cancer Image Classification
Task content:Extract the features of trained ResNet18 model from the last CNN layer and use these features to train a softmax model and compare the performances
